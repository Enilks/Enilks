Hey, I'm Kline Shimp. I'm a freshman at BYU majoring in Computer Science in the Pre-Animation Emphasis, with a minor in Creative Writing. I first gained experience writing comprehensive programs for my graphing calculator to make doing my homework easier (although any time those programs *did* save is likely negated by the hours I spent writing those programs). 

My blossoming interest in programming and computer science led me to get involved in AI Camp, a summer program where I learned the basics of machine learning and how AI works. Over the course of three weeks, I worked with a team to design, train, test, and deploy a computer vision model to analyze artwork and determine its movement or style. You can view the model on HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/satwikapaul/painting_movement_classifier2).

[My First Eldritch Evil](https://github.com/skidoodl/My-First-Eldritch-Evil) was created as a submission for the U.S. Congressional App Challenge. It's intended to be an alternative take on the virtual pet format, where the pet you lovingly raise is a demonic ancient horror. While the original app we created for the CAC was merely terminal based, I've spent several weeks learning Java Swing and AWT to implement a rudimentary GUI. Working with a classmate, I took on the role of project lead and designer.
