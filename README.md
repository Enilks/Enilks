Hey, I'm Kline Shimp, or @Enilks if you're looking to find me online. I'm a senior in high school with an interest in programming and computer science. I first gained experience writing comprehensive programs for my graphing calculator to make doing my homework easier (although any time those programs *did* save is likely negated by the hours I spent writing those programs). 

My blossoming interest in programming and computer science led me to get involved in AI Camp, a summer program where I learned the basics of machine learning and how AI works. Ober the course of 3 weeks, I worked with a team to design, train, test, and deploy a computer vision model to analyze artwork and determine the era or style the artwork was created in. You can view the model on HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/satwikapaul/painting_movement_classifier2).
