Hey, I'm Kline Shimp, or @Enilks if you're looking to find me online. I'm a senior in high school with an interest in programming and computer science. I first gained experience writing comprehensive programs for my graphing calculator to make doing my homework easier (although any time those programs *did* save is likely negated by the hours I spent writing those programs). 

My blossoming interest in programming and computer science led me to get involved in AI Camp, a summer program where I learned the basics of machine learning and how AI works. Ober the course of 3 weeks, I worked with a team to design, train, test, and deploy a computer vision model to analyze artwork and determine the movement or style the artwork was created in. You can view the model on HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/satwikapaul/painting_movement_classifier2).

Recently, I have begun learning to write in Java. These efforts include a submission for the U.S. Congressional App Challenge I wrote with a classmate, [My First Eldritch Evil](https://github.com/skidoodl/My-First-Eldritch-Evil). It's intended to be an alternative take on the Tamagotchi format, where the pet you lovingly raise is a demonic ancient horror. While the original app we created for the CAC was merely terminal based, I've spent several weeks learning Java Swing and AWT to implement a fun GUI. Having predominantly taken the role of project lead and designer, this little project is like my own pet. I have learned so much through it's creation and have thoroughly enjoyed the journey its taken me on.

A second project I've undertaken is much smaller and more of a personal learning tool: Sortbread. 

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Enilks! I'm just diving into the world of programming and computer science, and I hope to someday make a career in it!
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, as well as animation and game design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java. I'm also learning how to work with Large Language Models and how to implement conversational guardrails.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing idk 
- 📫 How to reach me ... find me on other platforms under the same username.
